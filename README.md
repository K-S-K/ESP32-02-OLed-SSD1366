#### It was interesting challenge during the project implementation.
It is happened that it is not a trivial task - to print data to the 128x32 display by the same way we expected after reading about printing to the 128x64 display. Look the [description of the experiment](docs/Ch01_LostBits.rst) if you are interested.
